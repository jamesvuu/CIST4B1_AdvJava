Some things I have learned in my first week of class in data structures is that a data structure is a way to be able to get data and organize it in a program. And I was also able to 
understand how algorithms are able to work on data strcutres. For example, you can search an array than remove it from the stack then you can add it to the queue. And I learned about an 
ADT which bascially describes what you are capable of doing with data and not how it is built.
