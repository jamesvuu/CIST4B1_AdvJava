About Me

My name is James Vu, I am currently in high school at Branham. I took AP Computer Science recently last year, and wanted to continue my coding journey, so I took this class. I decided to also become a data science major so this class would be very major for me. I am excited to learn more about coding and challenge myself this semester.

Goals for This Course

Some goals for this course  for me are that I want to learn more about coding, and also I want to get better at problem solving not just the syntax in general, and to be able to expand my knowledge in java. I am currently working on a project on my own about a card game, and I really want to expand my knowledge to be able to improve this game and to be able to read code easier.

        System.out.println(a);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class2 c2 = new Class2();
        c2.print();
